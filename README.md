A Django-based web application that uses **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning (TensorFlow)** to recommend movies.  
It offers **personalized suggestions**, displays **trending content**, and highlights the **most liked movies** — all in a user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ User Signup, Login & Logout
- 🎯 Personalized movie recommendations
- 📈 Trending movies based on popularity & views
- ❤️ Most liked movies (community favorites)
- ⭐ Rate and review system
- 🧠 TensorFlow & Scikit-learn-powered ML backend
- 🛠 Admin panel to manage content

---

## 🧠 How Recommendations Work

The backend uses a hybrid recommendation system:

- **Collaborative Filtering** (via `scikit-learn`)
- **Neural Network-based prediction** (via `TensorFlow`)
- Trending movies are computed using:
  - Number of ratings
  - Average rating
  - View count
- Most liked movies are sorted by user "likes"

> The model learns from user interactions and predicts which movies are most relevant for each individual.
